# Portfolio

## Description 

The goal of this project was to refactor our portfolio and bring it up to speed with the new frameworks we have been working with. In this case i decided to use bootstrap as it is the CSS framework I have the most experience with and know I could get the most out of it. The finished site was to have a polished look which is accomplished, the site is modern and clean gicing this portfolio a great look. It has a mobile first design so it looks good on any viewport and easy to read font and colors that do not cause eyestrain to the user. Tried to take a cool neutral tone approach to the style of the webpage. It has all the links that you would expect from a computer programmer, including github, linkedin and showcases all of the projects that I am proud of doing. Overall this portfolio has a good approachable design that lays out all the appropriate things a good portfolio should.
